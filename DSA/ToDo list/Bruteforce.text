1. Create a variable position with the value 0.
2. Check whether the number at index position in card equals query.
3. If it does, position is the answer and can be returned from the function.
4. If not, increment the value of position by 1, and repeat steps 2 to 5 till 
we reach the last position.
5. If the number was onot found, return -1.

This technique is called Linear Search Algorith
