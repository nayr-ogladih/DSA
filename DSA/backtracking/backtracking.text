# - a backtracking algorithm is a problem-solving algorithm that uses a brute force
    approach for finding the desired output.
# - backtracking checks whether the given node is avalid solution or not.
# - discard several invalid solutions with one iteration.
# - enumerate all subree of the node to find the valid solution.

# THREE TYPES
# - decision problem. -> search for a feasible solution.
# - optimization problem. -> search for the best solution.
# - enumeration problem. -> find all feasible solutions.
